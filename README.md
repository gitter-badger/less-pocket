# LESS: A Pocket Guide For Busy People

## Definition
[LESS](http://lesscss.org): Dynamic CSS preprocessor

## Purpose
Compile `.less` files into `.css` files.

## Overview

LESS files may (or may not) contain an advanced form of CSS. The LESS syntax supports variables, mixins, functions, and others features. Any block of standard CSS is valid LESS, but not the other way around.

See [LESS features](http://lesscss.org/features/).

## Compilers
Many compilers for many environments. Let's list a handful of them.
- [Node package](http://lesscss.org/usage/#command-line-usage)
- [Gulp plugin](https://github.com/plus3network/gulp-less)
- [Grunt plugin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-less)
- [GUI (graphic user interface) i.e. desktop apps](http://lesscss.org/usage/#guis-for-less)
- [Online tools](http://lesscss.org/usage/#online-less-compilers)

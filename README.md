## Definition

[LESS](http://lesscss.org) is a dynamic CSS preprocessor.

## Purpose

Compile `.less` files into standard `.css` files.

## Overview

- LESS files may contain standard CSS, or LESS syntax, which is an enriched form of CSS
- The LESS syntax adds support for features available in dynamic programming languages like variables, mixins, functions, and the like, to facilitate modular and salable CSS
- Any block of standard CSS is valid in LESS, but not the other way around
- All `.less` files must be compiled to standard `.css` before deploying your website

See a full list of [LESS features](http://lesscss.org/features/).

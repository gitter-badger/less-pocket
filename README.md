# LESS For Busy People

## Definition
Dynamic CSS preprocessor

## Purpose
Compile `.less` files into `.css` files. LESS files may contain an advanced form of CSS. LESS syntax supports variables, mixins, functions, and others fancy features.

If you have ever ventured to wirte more than 200 lines of CSS you'll probably love CSS. CSS preprocessors are so handy that must of us believe that once you try a preprocessor, you will never look back.

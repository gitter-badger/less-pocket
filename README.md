## Definition
[LESS](http://lesscss.org) is Dynamic CSS preprocessor

## Purpose
Compile `.less` files into standard `.css` files.

## Overview

LESS files may contain an advanced form of CSS. The LESS syntax supports new features like variables, mixins, functions, and other. Any block of standard CSS is valid LESS, but not the other way around.
